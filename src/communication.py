# This class is primarily useful for where once the program has started,
# there is no further interaction with the user. And it is useful for
# programs which want to be both gui and console, but not restrict
# the user to either. If it is primarily a console based program, then
# this class is not as useful for it.

# While I wait for the old wxPython to work with Python 3.0
# I am using zenity as my method for graphical communication.
# It is certainly inferior to wxPython, but I cannot do anything about that.
