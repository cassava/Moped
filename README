MPD Moped -- Driving your MPD playlists where they need to go!
Moped is an advanced playlist manipulator for the Music Player Daemon,
also known as MPD. The purpose is to provide a flexible and easy way to
add music to the playlist, as well as perform other extra tasks

This project started as essentially a hack: mpcadd.py, which I kept adding
things to, but which was not very well written. Hence, I wanted to rewrite
it in Java, but then decided Python was simply too good.
