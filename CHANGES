CHANGES: MOPED                                                         2.16
============================================================================

2.16  (20. March 2011)
This is a maintenance release, adding no extra features or bug fixes, rather
tidying up the project, restructuring it a little bit. 


2.14  (31. December 2009)
Same as the last release: a little bit of refactoring as well as improving
documentation.
Enhancements:
  - Completed the man page of Moped. Restructured Moped further.


2.13  (22. December 2009)
A little bit of refactoring as well as improving documentation.
Enhancements:
  - Added a manpage for Moped (not yet complete).


2.12  (7. October 2009)
Enhancements:
  - Added new feature: --filter-duplicates -x
    If I'm listening to one song, and I want to complete that album, then
    I can add the whole album. If I specify -x, it will make sure it doesn't
    add what's already in the playlist.
    Changed in function run() in class Moped. Added option filter_duplicates


2.11  (6. September 2009)
This release just fixes some bugs.
Bug Fixes:
  - #17. Required some code in function run() of class Moped


2.10  (8. June 2009)
Enhancements:
  - Shows python error messaegs now.
  - Show more (useful) error messages now: when the errors occur, more
    userfriendly.
  - Added some more exit codes: 3, 5 (see moped.py)
Changes:
  - The option -i does not count anymore
Bug Fixes:
  - #16, #18, #19, #20, #21, #22, #23, #26
  - Fixed withhold behaviour (so that it actually works)


2.9  (10. March 2009)
Changes:
  - Option shortcuts have been switched around a little bit.
        -i = --insert, -n = --no-shuffle, -s = --ishuffle


2.8  (7. February 2009)
Enhancements:
  - If Moped searches for songs, and no songs are in the results,
    then Moped no longer plays or plays the next song


2.7  (17. January 2009)
Changes:
  - Ceased to use stringutils.split() and stringutils.join() in moped.py


2.5  (17. January 2009)
Enhancements:
  - Added some more debug information level 3 (currentsong info etc)
 
      
2.0  (1. January 2009)
This is the first official release of the second version of Moped,
which is a complete rewrite of Moped, including the syntax.
The differences between Moped 2.0 and Moped 1.0 are roughly:

  * more features
  * clearer code
  * better syntax
