moped
======

Versions
  2.0 (01 Jan 2009)
     This is the first official release of the second version of Moped,
     which is a complete rewrite of Moped, including the syntax.
     The differences between Moped 2.0 and Moped 1.0 are roughly:
        - more features
        - clearer code
        - better syntax
  2.5 (17 Jan 2009)
      Added some more debug information level 3 (currentsong info etc)
  2.7 (17 Jan 2009)
      Ceased to use stringutils.split() and stringutils.join() in moped.py
  2.8 (07 Feb 2009)
      If Moped searches for songs, and no songs are in the results,
      then Moped no longer plays or plays the next song
  2.9 (10 Mar 2009)
      Option shortcuts have been switched around a little bit.
      -i = --insert, -n = --no-shuffle, -s = --ishuffle
  2.10 (08 Jun 2009)
      Bugs closed: #16, #18, #19, #20, #21, #22, #23, #26
      Shows python error messages now
      Added some more Exit Codes: 3, 5 (see moped.py)
      Fixed withhold behaviour (so that it actually works)
      Show more error messages now, when the errors occur, more userfriendly.
      -i does not count anymore
  2.11 (06 Sept 2009)
      Bugs fixed: #17
        Required some code in function run() of class Moped
  2.12 (07 Oct 2009)
      Added new feature: --filter-duplicates -x
        If I'm listening to one song, and I want to complete that album, then
        I can add the whole album. If I specify -x, it will make sure it doesn't
        add what's already in the playlist.
        Changed in function run() in class Moped. Added option filter_duplicates
  2.13 (22 Dec 2009)
      Restructured Moped and added a manpage for Moped.
  2.14 (31 Dec 2009)
      Completed the man page of Moped. Restructured Moped further.

      Added the playlist() function, to retrieve the current
      playlist and return it. Added the songlist() function,

      so that it is comparable to any other songlist.
      This was all necessary for the feature added in Moped 2.0.12
