stringutils.py #16:2009-01-17 [closed]
 [bug]
    there is a bug in stringutils.py in the split function. Or, rather, a bug
    in moped where the cause is in stringutils.
    Parsing the following line,
      -vv <a: Phil Joel tm:"You Belong To Me" "Call Unto Me">
    results in moped interpreting it as such:
      '<a: Phil Joel 'tm:You Belong To Me' 'Call Unto Me>'
    This is clearly false, and could be fixed in two ways. One way is that
    spaces be inserted. The second way is more complete, and perhaps desireable,
    however not much easier. It would involve in completely rewriting the
    split function utilizing regex.  
 [solution]
    moped stopped using this function, as it wasn't necessary.
    A normal split function seems to be sufficient. However,
    in the future, it will be seen if moped functions without it.
    mopedparser.py, however still needs these stringutils functions.

moped? #21:2009-05-03 [closed]
 [bug]
    try to run the command "moped -ccccccccc"
    and you shall see that it saves songs,
    but does nothing else.
 [solution]
    the problem was a name error
    at the same time fixed a bug that prevented exceptions from being shown.

mopedparser.py #22:2009-05-03 [closed]
 [enh]
    use the native crop function in the newer version of mpd.
 [comments]
    it's possible that we have to wait for the next release, because the
    release that said it supported it apparently did not. It's a shame,
    because mpd really needs to have some more of these basic functions.
 [solution:invalid]
    they haven't implemented this in the mpd server

moped.py #23:2009-05-03 [closed]
 [bug]
    when you use the gui it no longer automatically gives it the focus
    in the new XFCE4.6
 [comments]
    perhaps it is time to depart from zenity as a gui engine;
    it is anyway too slow to load. See if you can use a python solution again.
 [history]
    zenity was used because the python version of wxGTKPython was broken.
 [solution:won't fix]
    this is a problem with the xfce window manager: use OpenBox

mopedparser.py #18:2009-03-30 [closed]
 [bug]
    when parsing this "I'm Guilty", moped just dies silently,
    without giving any kind of error message.
 [comments]
    that's strange. Can you give any reason why it might be so?
    perhaps we need to work on some more debugging stuff.
 [debug]
    Moped: in run()
      parsing the search formula 'I'm Guilty'
 [solution]
    Catch MopedSyntaxException and then send user a message,
    fixed an issue in communication.py at the same time.

mopedparser.py #19:2009-03-30 [closed]
 [enh]
    automatically escape all single quotes,
    use double quotes to quote something.
    thus this wouldn't work:
        t: 'vertical stuff'
    but would have to be like this:
        t: "vertical stuff"
 [comments]
    would break unix style though, so I'm not sure if this is a
    good idea. It is also noteworthy to think of what happens on
    the unix command line when you use moped.
 [solution:won't fix]
    it would break unix style, this is a needless enhancement,
    though later it may be reopened.

moped.py #26:2009-06-08 [closed]
 [bug]
    mpd got updated. get in the middle of a playlist. Stop mpd, and then start.
    Add a song, and it started playing the song before that song. Didn't
    really try to reproduce it yet.
 [solution:works for me]
    can't reproduce it

mopedparser.py #20:2009-03-30 [closed]
 [bug]
    when inserting a song to a stopped playlist,
    decide where the song will go. Before or after.
    Right now it is after.
  [comments]
    In theory it should go after. But what happens when you have
    a large playlist, then after song #1? Then the problem is that
    when you play it skips the current song. So this is a bit of a
    stalemate. Need to decide upon something and then stick to it.
    
    I think actually before would make more sense.
  [job]
    test to see if it really is like that.
  [solution]
    leave it at after, to put it before would be a bit of work and
    would go against the style. Maybe some other day.

mopedparser.py #17:2009-03-10 [closed]
 [bug]
    there is a bug such that when a filter search fails, but each of the
    individual searches do not, then there is no error message.
    I wonder, the optimal correction would require a restructuring.
    It is anyway very confusing, the way it is coded at the moment.
    If Bug/enhancement #15 were addressed, then this would be too.
 [comments]
    If you run '<a: Michael Card t: Lost>'
       artist "Michael Card" finds something, and
       title "Lost" finds something,
       but the merge does not. Perhaps check a merge?
 [solution]
    It is fixed, but it is a messy fix. Note to improve the implementation
    of this solution once bug #15 and bug #29 are fixed.

mopedparser.py #29:2009-09-06 [closed]
 [enh-bug]
    put some code from _process_unit into a separate function:
    the code takes a search segment and reduces it down.
    This would simplify the solving of bug #17.
 [solution:obsolete]
    Obsolete. Works for me right now. Can't remember what I wanted to do.
