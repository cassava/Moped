TODO: MOPED
=======================================================================

Rewrite Moped to make it more modular, maybe rewrite it in Haskell (just for
the heck of it).

Integrate the functioning diffuse algorithm (see `docs/dev/Diffuse/`).

On installation have python compile the libraries into python bytecode.
