FUTURE
=======
These are suggestions to improve on in the future.

  * Ability to intelligently shuffle the current playlist,
    leaving the current song at the top, like mpd does it.
  * Ability to shuffle the part of playlist that is after
    the current song, like Rio does it.
  * Improve the intelligent shuffle algorithm, because at
    the moment it is not so good. See 'intelligent-shuffle'
  * Include playlist support. See the playlist folder
    for an example.


===========================================================


filter(songlist, removelist) -> songlist
parse(string) -> object
process(object) -> results
    results.searches[] # individual searches get combined in the end
    results.insertlist
    results.removelist
    results.string
    results.object
blacklist(results, aggresive=False) -> results
    filters songs from insertlist
    if aggresive,
        adds blacklist to removelist
filter_duplicates(results) -> results


feature ideas:

tB: get the album of the track that you find
tT: get the track that you search for
tA: get the artist of the track that you search for


what if you want to add the album of a track sorted after it, excluding that track.
What if you only want to filter that track from it?

bug: right now when you have a shuffled album, and you run -cnx b: that album,
it will insert 0 songs, because all have been removed due to -x. In other words,
-x acts before the list has been cropped or modified. That's not so good.
